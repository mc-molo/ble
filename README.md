# Peripheral

Goal is to provide a vary basic peripheral service based on bleno-peripheral by zdennis.
All I want to do (for now) is to send a byte string to the peripheral (and send a response back).

### Install

Install dependencies:

    npm install

### Run

On OSX you can start with:

    node bePeripheral.js

On Linux you need to super user privileges:

    sudo peripheral.js
